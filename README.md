# Shower Logic

## Installation

## Frontend

1. Install `node` & `yarn` (if you don't already have them)
2. Run the following from the project's root:
   `yarn install && (cd web && yarn install)`
3. Navigate to `web` directory and run `yarn start` to start serving the frontend application

## Server

1. Install `Xcode` (make sure you have the command line tools installed. Can be done just by simply opening the application)
2. Install the `Vapor Toolbox` by following [these instructions](https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/install/macos/)
3. Run `vapor build` to install the dependencies as defined by `Package.swift`
4. Run `vapor run` to start the server
